# HoverFish

In the summer of my first year at NTU, I enrolled in PS9888 Making and Tinkering, a special term module meant to provide students with the opportunity to solve open-ended real life problems. The module aims to allow students to pick up hands-on expertise in building something which put the knowledge they learnt from their disciplines to practical use.

Having just completed our first year at NTU, the amount of knowledge we had picked up in our respective disciplines may not have been much, but nevertheless we sought to build something ambitious. After much deliberation, we choose to build a balloon drone to explore another approach to flight, as opposed to the now ubiquitous quadcopters.

We began with a rough sizing of the drone as well as looking into the mobility of such a contraption by reverse engineering similar toys we discovered on the internet. To ensure our product's uniqueness, we decided to modernize the concept, adding in a video feed to the drone as well as the ability to control it over local wifi networks.

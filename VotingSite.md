# CN Yang Executive Committee Voting Site

In my second year of university, I was commissioned to develop an online voting system for the CN Yang Scholars Progamme, which would allow them to move away from physical ballots to an electronic voting system. The system was developed to cut down on the paper used for the physical ballots, as well as reduce the logistics invovled. The electronic voting system would also allow year 3 and 4 scholars on their overseas exchange and final year projects to have a say.

For this project I made use of python and the flask package to generate the site.

# Who Am I?
I am a software engineer with a Aerospace Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering from NTU.

I do anything from webdev to building drones, so please take a look at what I've done.

# Projects

## [Unique Flight Controller for Multirotor drones](FYP.md)
My Final Year Project for my Aerospace Engineering degree in which I designed an implemented unique flight controller on a UAV whose parts I designed and 3D printed.


## [HoverFish](HoverFish.md)
An award winning remote-controlled balloon drone designed and built for PS9888 Making and Tinkering, a special term module held at NTU.


## [Motion Based Multi Object Tracker](SPOTIT.md)
Internship with Temasek Laboratories @ NUS, with the aim of developing a real time 3D drone tracking system using computer vision to detect and track multiple moving objects in a scene.


## [Sound Site](SoundSite.md)
A React App built with React Flow allowing users to see and touch sound to create their own sounds.


## [CS50 Intro to Artificial Intelligence Certification from Harvard](CS50ai.md)
A series of projects under the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence online course offered by Harvard as part of their CS50 programme, which culminated in a degree.


## [Virutal Face](VirtualFace.md)
A face and pose tracking solution with a companion renderer for immersive control of virtual avatars.


## [Inverse Kinematics solver using deep learning](DeepArm.md)
Using deep learning solution for inverse kinematic problems to avoid the complexity of analytical and numerical methods for 3 dimensional mechanisms.


## [GW2 Market Analysis](GW2MarketAnalysis.md)
A market visualization tool making use of historical data to aid investment decisions.


## [CN Yang Executive Committee Voting Site](VotingSite.md)
A online voting portal commissioned by the 10th Executive Committee of the CN Yang Scholars Club.


## [Drone Simulator](DroneSimulator.md)
A project started in Python then continued in Unity to get a better appreciation for concepts I studied in University such as dynamics and control theory.


## [Meal Diary](MealDiary.md)
An Android app for users to keep track of their eating habits by means of a picture diary.


## [Handy Umbrella Dryer](HUD.md)
A simple device to address the issue of wet portable umbrellas designed and built for the Engineering, Innovation and Design module at NTU.


## [Guitar Companion](EGuitarMod.md)
A python script for adding real time digital audio effects based off guitar effects.


## [Parameterization Study of The Efficiency of a Piezoelectric Flutter Based Harvester](CY1400.md)
An experiment conducted in the low speed wind tunnel at NTU to investigate how the aerodynamic phenomenon of flutter can be used to generate electricity using a piezoelectric harvester.


## [Subjective Testing Of Parametrically-decoded First-Order Ambisonics In Cinematically-reproduced Virtual Reality](CY2001.md)
Research attachment at the Digital Signal Laboratory at NTU evaluating audio decoding techniques for virtual reality using subjective testing methods.

# Handy Umbrella Dryer

The Handy Umbrella Dryer was a product developed by my Engineering, Innovation and Design (EID) group for the module of the same name. It was a simple idea, but one with a potential that would see it outshine other more ambitious plans to emerge as a simple but well-received product at the showcase at the end of the module, seen in this picture of it and the team that designed it.

On its inception, the umbrella dryer was nothing more than a bottle to hold wet foldable umbrellas to ensure that their contents would not leak. The idea grew traction however, when we saw its potential to be something greater, a small piece of equipment that could be used to dry your umbrellas on the go, or in a hurry, incorporating a number of design features to increase its efficiency.

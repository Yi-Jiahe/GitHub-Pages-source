Meal Diary is an app meant to help users keep track of their diet in order to assist them in eating healthier. It seeks to do so by simplifying the process of recording one's meals, encourging awareness over counting calories by making creating a new entry as easy as simply taking a picture of your meal.

While this was not techincally my first foray into app development for I had created a simple web app a number of years earlier, it was my first time writing an app specifically for android in Kotlin. The reason I had chosen to create the app was because I felt that the introduction of Kotlin and Android Studio made the app development process more accessible than before, and I thought that it was my turn to give it a shot.

When I first started learning Kotlin, I picked up most of the basic skills from the tutorial by Google by building and experimenting with their introductory apps, incorporating the knowledge I gained from them into my own app. However, as my app grew more complex with more interations and features, I had to cast my net wider and scour the internet or possible solutions to the difficulties I began to encounter. After much trial and error, I had finally managed to include the features I had desired to include.

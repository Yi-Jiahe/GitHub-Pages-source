# Motion Based Multiple Object Tracking
During the summer of my 3rd year, I did an internship with Temasek Laboratories at NUS. During my internship, I worked on developing an algorithm to detect and track mulitple moving objects in a scene, and return their 3D positions in real time.

My first task during the internship was to implement an algorithm tested in MATLAB into Python. To do so, I made use of the OpenCV library and got to know the functionality it provided in terms of image and video processing and methods for extracting useful information from images and videos. I also familiarsed myself with data visualization using a combination of OpenCV and the python plotting library matplotlib.

From there, I also studied photogrammetry,
